# Doom Fire in C++ 

A version of the Doom Fire effect, inspired by the excellent article by [Fabien Sanglard](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/).

Largely just a simple C++ port of another small C project for some experimentation with CMake, naming conventions, and general malarky.

## Requirements
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) development libraries and headers should be extracted to `./libs/SDL2` folder

## TODO
- const some stuff?
- Split buffer class 
- Cleanup palette class
